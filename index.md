I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student in Software Engineering at Iowa State University. 

I am seeking acceptance to a Ph.D. program in computer science with a focus in quantum computation and quantum complexity.

I can be reached at <span id="_eml" class="gl-eml">someone at example dot com</span>.

Use #bibitem_Venue_Key to refer to "Venue:Key".

It is possible to have multiple BibTeX blocks, which will be rendered independently. For example, you might want to have one block for each of "Publications", "Pre-prints", and "Manuscripts".

To support more information links (e.g., add "slides" or "pdf" links),
see "builder/marked.0.3.6/bibtex-service.js" line 109.
